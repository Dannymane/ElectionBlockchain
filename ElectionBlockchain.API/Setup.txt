How to setup blockchain network

1) Reset citizens, save generated signed votes (the citizens' decisions are random)
2) Setup nodes id: GET setup/node/{id} '1'- Verifier1 '2'- Verifier2 '3'- Leader
3) Generate nodes keys: GET setup/GenerateNodeKeys
4) Setup nodes private keys: POST setup/node/PrivateKey (for every node)
5) Get nodes ip: GET setup/node/ip   In docker its enough to know only the ip 
6) Set nodes ip: POST setup/node/{Verifier1 | Verifier2 | Leader}/{ip} (every nove ip for every node) 
7) Add nodes to nodes' databases: POST database/addnode (Id, IP, PublicKey)

8) Send signed votes to leader: POST /leader/vote







//3 nodes will be added in a special order, 1- Verifier1 2- Verifier2 3- Leader
