How to setup blockchain network


2) Setup nodes id: GET setup/node/{id} '1'- Verifier1 '2'- Verifier2 '3'- Leader
3) Generate nodes keys: GET setup/GenerateNodeKeys
4) Setup nodes private keys: POST setup/node/PrivateKey (for every node)
5) Setup nodes public keys: POST setup/node/PublicKey/{Verifier1 | Verifier2 | Leader} (for every node)
5) Get nodes ip: GET setup/node/ip   In docker its enough to know only the ip 
6) Set nodes ip: POST setup/node/{Verifier1 | Verifier2 | Leader}/{ip} (every node ip for every node
1) Reset citizens (on leader, he will send citizens to another nodes), save generated signed votes (the citizens' decisions are random)
7) Add nodes to nodes' databases: POST database/addnode (Id, IP, PublicKey)

8) Send signed votes to leader: POST /leader/vote







//3 nodes will be added in a special order, 1- Verifier1 2- Verifier2 3- Leader
